### Assignment: logistic_regression_sgd
#### Date: Deadline: Oct 28, 22:00
#### Points: 5 points
#### Tests: logistic_regression_sgd_tests

Starting with the [logistic_regression_sgd.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl129/tree/past-2425/labs/03/logistic_regression_sgd.py),
implement minibatch SGD for logistic regression.

#### Tests Start: logistic_regression_sgd_tests
_Note that your results may be slightly different (because of varying floating point arithmetic on your CPU)._
