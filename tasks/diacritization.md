### Assignment: diacritization
#### Date: Deadline: Nov 18, 22:00
#### Points: 5 points+5 bonus

The goal of the `diacritization` [competition task](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/courses/npfl129/2425-winter#competitions)
is to learn to add diacritics to the given Czech text. We will use a small
collection of [fiction books](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~courses/npfl129/2425/datasets/fiction-train.txt),
which is available under [CC BY-NC-SA license](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~courses/npfl129/2425/datasets/fiction-train.LICENSE).
Note that these texts are the only allowed training data, you cannot use any
other Czech texts (even manually annotated) to train or evaluate your model.
At the test time, you will be given a text without diacritics and you should return
it including diacritical marks – to be explicit, we only consider diacritized
letters `áčďéěíňóřšťúůýž` and their uppercase variants.

The [diacritization.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl129/tree/past-2425/labs/05/diacritization.py)
template shows how to load the training data, downloading it if needed.

Each sentence in the data is stored on a single line, with exactly one
space character separating input words. The performance of your system is
measured using _word accuracy_ (the percentage of words you diacritized
correctly, as computed by the
[diacritization_eval.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl129/tree/past-2425/labs/05/diacritization_eval.py)
script) and your goal is to achieve at least **86.5%**. You can use **any sklearn
algorithm** with the **exception of decision trees** to solve this assignment (so no
random forests, extra trees, gradient boosting, AdaBoost with decision trees, …).
