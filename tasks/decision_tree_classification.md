### Assignment: decision_tree_classification
#### Date: Deadline: Dec 08, 23:59
#### Points: 8 points
#### Examples: decision_tree_classification_examples

Starting with the [decision_tree_classification.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl129/tree/master/labs/06/decision_tree_classification.py),
implement construction of a classification decision tree, supporting both
`gini` and `entropy` criteria, and `max_depth`, `min_to_split` and `max_leaves`
constraints.

In this assignment, you will get partial points during ReCodEx evaluation,
depending on which argument values your solution support.
