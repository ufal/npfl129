#### Points: 4 points+5 bonus

This assignment is a [competition task](#competitions). Your goal
is to perform binary classification – given medical data with 15 binary and
6 real attributes, predict whether thyroid is functioning normally or not.
The train set and test set consist of ~3.5k instances.

The [thyroid_competition.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl129/tree/master/labs/03/thyroid_competition.py)
template shows how to load training data, downloading it if needed.
Furthermore, it shows how to save a trained estimator and how to load it during
prediction.

The performance of your system is measured using _accuracy_ of correctly
predicted examples. Note that you can use any number of **logistic and linear
regression models** to solve this assignment.
