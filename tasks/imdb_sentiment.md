### Assignment: imdb_sentiment
#### Date: Deadline: Nov 25, 22:00
#### Points: 3 points

Using the [imdb_sentiment.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl129/tree/past-2425/labs/06/imdb_sentiment.py)
template, perform classification of text documents from the
[Large Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).
The template also downloads pretrained word embeddings from FastText
containing only words from our dataset.

Analogously to competition assignments, your task is to submit a trained model
that will perform classification on the test set given to you during
ReCodEx evaluation. The performance is measured using accuracy, and your goal
is to achieve at least **80%**.
