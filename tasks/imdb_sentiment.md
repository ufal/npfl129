### Assignment: imdb_sentiment
#### Date: Deadline: Nov 21, 7:59 a.m.
#### Points: 3 points

Using the [imdb_sentiment.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl129/tree/master/labs/06/imdb_sentiment.py)
template, perform classification of text documents from the
[Large Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).
The template also downloads pretrained word embeddings from FastText
containing only words from our dataset.

Analogously to competition assignments, your task is to submit a trained model
that will perform classification on the test set given to you during
ReCodEx evaluation. The performance is measured using accuracy, and your goal
is to achieve at least 80%.
