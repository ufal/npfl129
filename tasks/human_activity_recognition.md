### Assignment: human_activity_recognition
#### Date: Deadline: Dec 16, 22:00
#### Points: 2 points+4 bonus

The goal of this [competition task](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/courses/npfl129/2425-winter#competitions)
is to perform human activity recognition, namely to recognize one
of five actions (`walking`, `standing`, `sitting`, `standing up`, `sitting down`)
using data from four accelerometers. The train set consists of 50k
examples, the test set of approximately 115k.

The [human_activity_recognition.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl129/tree/past-2425/labs/10/human_activity_recognition.py)
template shows how to load the training data, downloading it if needed.

Your model will be evaluated using _accuracy_ and your goal is to achieve at
least 99.25%. Note that you can use **any sklearn algorithm** to solve this
assignment.
