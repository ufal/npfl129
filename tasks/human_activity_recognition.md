#### Points: 4 points+4 bonus

This assignment is a [competition task](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/courses/npfl129/2021-winter#competitions). Your goal
is to perform human activity recognition, namely to recognize one
of five actions (walking, standing, sitting, standing up, sitting down)
using data from four accelerometers. The train set consists of 50k
examples, the test set of approximately 115k.

The [human_activity_recognition.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl129/tree/master/labs/09/human_activity_recognition.py)
template shows how to load the training data, downloading it if needed.

Your model will be evaluated using _accuracy_ and your goal is to achieve at
least 99%. Note that you can use **any sklearn algorithm** to solve this
exercise.
