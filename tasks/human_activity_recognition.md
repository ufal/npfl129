### Assignment: human_activity_recognition
#### Date: Deadline: Jan 05, 23:59
#### Points: 4 points+4 bonus

This assignment is a [competition task](#competitions). Your goal
is to perform human activity recognition, namely to recognize one
of five actions (walking, standing, sitting, standing up, sitting down)
using data from four accelerometers.

The [human_activity_recognition.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl129/tree/past-1920/labs/08/human_activity_recognition.py)
template loads the training data, downloading it if needed, and
shows how to save a compressed trained estimator and how to load it in
`recodex_predict` method.

Your model will be evaluated using _accuracy_ and your goal is to achieve at
least 99%. Note that you can use **any sklearn algorithm** to solve this
exercise.
