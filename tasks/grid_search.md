### Assignment: grid_search
#### Date: Deadline: Oct 28, 22:00
#### Points: 2 points
#### Tests: grid_search_tests
#### Examples: grid_search_examples

Starting with [grid_search.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl129/tree/past-2425/labs/03/grid_search.py)
template, perform a hyperparameter grid search, evaluating hyperparameter performance
using a stratified k-fold crossvalidation, and finally evaluate a model
trained with best hyperparameters on all training data. The easiest way is
to utilize `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV`.

#### Tests Start: grid_search_tests
_Note that your results may be slightly different (because of varying floating point arithmetic on your CPU)._

1. `python3 grid_search.py --test_size=0.5`
```
Test accuracy: 98.11%
```

2. `python3 grid_search.py --test_size=0.7`
```
Test accuracy: 96.26%
```
