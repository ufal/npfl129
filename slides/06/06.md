# Kernel Trick

When dimensionality of input is $D$, one step of SGD takes $𝓞(D^3)$.

Surprisingly, we can do better under some circumstances. We start by
noting that we can write the parameters $→w$ as a linear combination
of the input features $φ(→x_i)$.

By induction, $→w = 0 = ∑_i 0 ⋅ φ(→x_i)$, and assuming $→w = ∑_i β_i ⋅ φ(→x_i)$,
after a SGD update we get
$$\begin{aligned}
→w ←& →w + α∑_i \big(t_i - →w^T φ(→x_i)\big) φ(→x_i)\\
   =& ∑_i \Big(β_i + α \big(t_i - →w^T φ(→x_i)\big)\Big) φ(→x_i).
\end{aligned}$$

A individual update is $β_i ← β_i + α\Big(t_i - →w^T φ(→x_i)\Big)$, and
substituting for $→w$ we get
$$β_i ← β_i + α\Big(t_i - ∑\nolimits_j β_j φ(→x_j)^T φ(→x_i)\Big).$$

# Kernel Trick

We can formulate the alternative linear regression algorithm (it would be called
a _dual formulation_):

<div class="algorithm">

**Input**: Dataset ($⇉X ∈ ℝ^{N×D}$, $→t ∈ ℝ^N$), learning rate $α ∈ ℝ^+$.<br>

- Set $β_i ← 0$
- Compute all values $K(→x_i, →x_j) = φ(→x_i)^T φ(→x_j)$
- Repeat
  - $β_i ← β_i + α\Big(t_i - ∑\nolimits_j β_j K(→x_i, →x_j)\Big)$

    In vector notation, we can write $→β ← →β + α(→t-K→β)$.
</div>

The predictions are then performed by computing $∑_i β_i →φ(→z)^T →φ(→x_i)$.

# Kernels

We define a _kernel_ corresponding to a feature map $φ$ as a function
$$K(→x, →z) ≝ φ(→x)^t φ(→z).$$

There is quite a lot of theory behind kernel construction. The most often used
kernels are:

- polynomial kernel or degree $d$
  $$K(→x, →z) = (γ →x^T→z - 1)^d,$$
  which corresponds to a feature map generating all combinations of up to $d$
  input features;
- Gaussian (or RBF) kernel
  $$K(→x, →z) = e^{-γ||→x-→z||^2},$$
  corresponding to a scalar product in an infinite-dimensional space (it is
  in a sense a combination of polynomial kernels of all degrees).

# Support Vector Machines

Assume we have a dataset $⇉X ∈ ℝ^{N×D}$, $→t ∈ \{-1, 1\}^N$, feature map $φ$ and model
$$y(→x) ≝ →φ(→x)^T →w + b.$$

![w=30%,f=right](../03/binary_classification.pdf)

We already know that the distance of a point $→x_i$ to the decision boundary is
$$\frac{|y(→x_i)|}{||→w||} = \frac{t_i y(→x_i)}{||→w||}.$$

We therefore want to maximize
$$\argmax_{w,b} \frac{1}{||→w||} \min_i \big[t_i (→φ(→x)^T →w + b)\big].$$

However, this problem is difficult to optimize directly.

---
# Support Vector Machines

Because the model is invariant to multiplying $→w$ and $b$ by a constant, we can
say that for the points closest to the decision boundary, it will hold that
$$t_i y(→x_i) = 1.$$

Then for all the points we will have $t_i y(→x_i) ≥ 1$ and we can simplify
$$\argmax_{w,b} \frac{1}{||→w||} \min_i \big[t_i (→φ(→x)^T →w + b)\big]$$
to
$$\argmin_{w,b} \frac{1}{2} ||→w||^2 \textrm{~given that~~}t_i y(→x_i) ≥ 1.$$

---
# Support Vector Machines

In order to solve the constrained problem of
$$\argmin_{w,b} \frac{1}{2} ||→w||^2 \textrm{~given that~~}t_i y(→x_i) ≥ 1,$$
we write the Lagrangian with multipliers $→a=(a_1, …, a_N)$ as
$$L = \frac{1}{2} ||→w||^2 - ∑_i a_i \big[t_i y(→x_i) - 1\big].$$

Setting the derivatives with respect to $→w$ and $b$ to zero, we get
$$\begin{aligned}
→w =& ∑_i a_i t_iφ(→x_i) \\
 0 =& ∑_i a_i t_i \\
\end{aligned}$$

---
# Support Vector Machines

Substituting these to the Lagrangian, we get
$$L = ∑_i a_i -  \frac{1}{2} ∑_i ∑_j a_i a_j t_i t_j K(→x_i, →x_j)$$
with respect to the constraints $∀_i: a_i ≥ 0$, $∑_i a_i t_i = 0$
and kernel $K(→x, →z) = φ(→x)^T φ(→z).$

The solution of this Lagrangian will fulfil the KKT conditions, meaning that
$$\begin{aligned}
a_i &≥ 0 \\
t_i y(→x_i) - 1 &≥ 0 \\
a_i \big(t_i y(→x_i) - 1\big) &= 0.
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, either a point is on a boundary, or $a_i=0$. Given that the
predictions for point $→x$ are given by $y(→x) = ∑ a_i t_i K(→x, →x_i) + b$,
we need to keep only the points on the boundary, the so-called **support vectors**.

# Support Vector Machines for Non-linearly Separable Data

![w=28%,f=right](svm_softmargin.pdf)

Until now, we assumed the data to be linearly separable – the  
**hard-margin SVM** variant. We now relax this condition to arrive at
**soft-margin SVM**.
~~~
The idea is to allow points to be in the margin or even on the _wrong side_ of
the decision boundary. We introduce _slack variables_ $ξ_i ≥ 0$, one for each
training instance, defined as
$$ξ_i = \begin{cases} 0 &\textrm{~for points fulfilling~}t_i y(→x_i) ≥ 1,\\
                      |t_i - y(→x_i)|&\textrm{~otherwise}.\end{cases}$$

~~~
Therefore, $ξ_i=0$ signifies a point outside of margin, $0 < ξ_i < 1$ denotes
a point inside the margin, $ξ_i=1$ is a point on the decision boundary and
$ξ_i>1$ indicates the point is on the opposite side of the separating
hyperplane.

~~~
Therefore, we want to optimize
$$\argmin_{w,b} C ∑_i ξ_i + \frac{1}{2} ||→w||^2 \textrm{~given that~~}t_i y(→x_i) ≥ 1 - ξ_i\textrm{~and~}ξ_i ≥ 0.$$

---
# Support Vector Machines for Non-linearly Separable Data

We again create a Lagrangian, this time with multipliers $→a=(a_1, …, a_N)$
and also $→μ=(μ_1, …, μ_N)$:
$$L = \frac{1}{2} ||→w||^2 + C ∑_i ξ_i - ∑_i a_i \big[t_i y(→x_i) - 1 + ξ_i\big] - ∑_i μ_i ξ_i.$$

~~~
Solving for the critical points and substituting for $→w$, $b$ and $→ξ$ (obtaining an additional
constraint $μ_i = C - a_i$ compared to the previous case), we obtain the Lagrangian in the form
$$L = ∑_i a_i -  \frac{1}{2} ∑_i ∑_j a_i a_j t_i t_j K(→x_i, →x_j),$$
which is identical to the previous case, but the constraints are a bit
different:
$$∀_i: C ≥ a_i ≥ 0\textrm{~and~}∑_i a_i t_i = 0.$$

---
# Support Vector Machines for Non-linearly Separable Data

Using KKT conditions, we can see that the support vectors (examples with
$a_i>0$) are the ones with $t_i y(→x_i) = 1 - ξ_i$.

# SGD-like Formulation of Soft-Margin SVM

Note that the slack variables can be written as
$$ξ_i = \max\big(0, 1 - t_i y(→x_i)\big),$$
so we can reformulate the soft-margin SVM objective using **hinge loss**
$$𝓛_\textrm{hinge}(t, y) ≝ \max(0, 1 - t y)$$
to
$$\argmin_{w,b} C ∑_i 𝓛_\textrm{hinge}\big(t_i, y(→x_i)\big) + \frac{1}{2} ||→w||^2 .$$

~~~
Such formulation is analogous to a regularized loss, where $C$ is an _inverse_
regularization strength, so $C=∞$ implies no regularization and $C=0$ ignores
the data entirely.

# Comparison of Linear and Logistic Regression and SVM

For $f(→x; →w, b) ≝ →φ(→x)^T →w + b$, we have seen the following losses:

| Model | Objective | Per-Instance Loss |
|:------|:----------|:------------------|
| Linear<br>Regression | $\small \argmin_{→w,b} ∑_i 𝓛_\textrm{MSE}\big(t_i, f(→x_i)\big) + \frac{1}{2} λ \|→w\|^2$ | $\small 𝓛_\textrm{MSE}(t, y) = \frac{1}{2}(t - y)^2$ |
| Logistic<br>regression | $\small \argmin_{→w,b} ∑_i 𝓛_\textrm{σ-NLL}\big(t_i, f(→x_i)\big) + \frac{1}{2} λ \|→w\|^2$ | $\small 𝓛_\textrm{σ-NLL}(t, y) = - \log \begin{pmatrix}σ(y)^t +\\ \big(1-σ(y)\big)^{1-t}\end{pmatrix}$ |
| Softmax<br>regression | $\small \argmin_{⇉W,→b} ∑_i 𝓛_\textrm{s-NLL}\big(t_i, f(→x_i)\big) + \frac{1}{2} λ \|→w\|^2$ | $\small 𝓛_\textrm{s-NLL}(t, →y) = - \log \softmax(→y)_t$ |
| SVM | $\small \argmin_{→w,b} C ∑_i 𝓛_\textrm{hinge}\big(t_i, f(→x_i)\big) + \frac{1}{2} \|→w\|^2$ | $\small 𝓛_\textrm{hinge}(t, y) = \max(0, 1 - ty)$ |

~~~
Note that $\small 𝓛_\textrm{MSE}(t, y) ∝ -\log\big(𝓝(t; μ=y, σ^2=1)\big)$ and
that $\small 𝓛_\textrm{σ-NLL}(t, y) = 𝓛_\textrm{s-NLL}(t, [y, 0])$.

# Binary Classification Loss Functions Comparison

To compare various functions for binary classification, we need to formulate
them all in the same settings, with $t ∈ \{-1, 1\}$.

~~~
- MSE: $(ty - 1)^2$, because it is $(y - 1)^2$ for $t=1$ and $(-y - t)^2$ for $t=-1$
~~~
- LR: $σ(ty)$, because it is $σ(y)$ for $t=1$ and $1-σ(y)=σ(-y)$ for $t=-1$
~~~
- SVM: $\max(0, 1 - ty)$

# Sequential Minimal Optimization Algorithm

To solve the dual formulation of a SVM, usually Sequential Minimal Optimization
(SMO; John Platt, 1998) algorithm is used.

~~~
Before we introduce it, we start by introducing **coordinate descent**
optimization algorithm.

~~~
Consider solving unconstrained optimization problem
$$\argmin_→w L(w_1, w_2, …, w_D).$$

~~~
Instead of the usual SGD approach, we could optimize the weights one by one,
using the following algorithm

<div class="algorithm">

- loop until convergence
  - for $i$ in $\{1, 2, …, D\}$:
    - $w_i ← \argmin\nolimits_{w_i} L(w_1, w_2, …, w_D)$
</div>

# Sequential Minimal Optimization Algorithm

<div class="algorithm">

- loop until convergence
- for $i$ in $\{1, 2, …, D\}$:
  - $w_i ← \argmin\nolimits_{w_i} L(w_1, w_2, …, w_D)$
</div>

![w=42%,f=right](coordinate_descent.pdf)

If the inner $\argmin$ can be performed efficiently, the coordinate descent can
be fairly efficient.


~~~
Note that we might want to choose $w_i$ in different order, for example
by trying to choose $w_i$ providing the largest decrease of $L$.

---
# Sequential Minimal Optimization Algorithm

In soft-margin SVM, we try to minimize
$$L = ∑_i a_i -  \frac{1}{2} ∑_i ∑_j a_i a_j t_i t_j K(→x_i, →x_j),$$
such that
$$∀_i: C ≥ a_i ≥ 0\textrm{~and~}∑_i a_i t_i = 0.$$

~~~
The KKT conditions for the solution are
$$\begin{aligned}
  a_i = 0 & ⇒ t_i y(→x_i) ≥ 1, \textrm{~~because in this case }μ_i = C\textrm{ and therefore }ξ_i=0 \\
  a_i = C & ⇒ t_i y(→x_i) ≤ 1, \textrm{~~because in this case }t_i y(→x_i) - 1 + ξ_i = 0\textrm{ for }ξ_i≥0 \\
  0 < a_i < C & ⇒ t_i y(→x_i) = 1, \textrm{~~because in this case both above reasonings apply}
\end{aligned}$$

---
# Sequential Minimal Optimization Algorithm

At its core, the SMO algorithm is just a coordinate descent.

~~~
It tries to find such $α_i$ fulfilling the KKT conditions – it can be shown that
any such weights are the solution of the optimization problem.

~~~
However, note that because of the $∑a_i t_i = 0$ constraint we cannot optimize
just one $a_i$, because a single $a_i$ is determined from the others.

~~~
Therefore, in each step we pick two $a_i, a_j$ coefficients and try to minimize
the loss while fulfilling the constraints.

~~~
<div class="algorithm">

- loop until convergence (until $∀ i: a_i < C ⇒ t_i y(→x_i) ≥ 1$ and $a_i > 0 ⇒  t_i y(→x_i) ≤ 1$)
  - for $i$ in $\{1, 2, …, D\}$, for $j ≠ i$ in $\{1, 2, …, D\}:
    - $a_i, a_j ← \argmin\nolimits_{a_i, a_j} L(a_1, a_2, …, a_D)$ such that $C ≥ a_i ≥ 0$, $∑_i a_i t_i = 0$
</div>

---
# Sequential Minimal Optimization Algorithm

The SMO is an efficient algorithm, because we can compute the update to
$a_i, a_j$ efficiently, because there exists an closed form solution.

~~~
Assume WLOG that we are updating $a_1$ and $a_2$. Then from the $∑_i a_i t_i = 0$ condition we can
write $a_2 t_2 = -∑_{i≠2} a_i t_i$. Given that $t_2^2 = 1$ and denoting $ζ=-∑_{i≥3} a_i t_i$, we get
$$a_2 = t_2 (ζ-a_1 t_1).$$

~~~
Minimizing $L(→a)$ with respect to $a_1$ and $a_2$ then amounts to minimizing
a quadratic function of $a_1$, which has an analytical solution.

~~~
Details (exact form of $a_1$ and value of $b$) will be derived on the
practicals.

~~~
Note that the real SMO algorithm has several heuristics for choosing $a_i, a_j$
such that the $L$ can be minimized the most.

# Classification Decision Trees

Assume the average probability for class $k$ in a region $𝓡$ is $p(𝓡)_k$
and that number of data in region $𝓡$ is $n(𝓡)$.

~~~
The goal is to find a feature and its value such that when splitting a region,
the resulting regions have minimal criterion value, where the criterion value
is weighted by the size of the region $n(𝓡)$.

- **Entropy Criterion**

  $$-n(𝓡) ∑_k p(𝓡)_k \log p(𝓡)_k$$
